 <h1> Overview </h1>

This project aims to design and implement a robust data feature extraction and retrieval pipeline that supports multimodal data — including text, images, and metadata. The system focuses on efficient storage, retrieval, and visualization with high accuracy, low latency, and strong fault tolerance.
By integrating database optimization, hybrid search, and API-driven architecture, it serves as a scalable foundation for production-ready applications.

 <h1> Objectives & Deliverables </h1>
 <h2> Data Visualization Tool </h2>

Goal: Develop or integrate an interface for visualizing retrieved data.

Deliverable: A visualization layer ensuring accurate and user-friendly rendering of query results.

<h2> Optimized Image Embedding Storage </h2>  

Goal: Store and retrieve image embeddings efficiently to enable high-speed similarity search.

Deliverable: Optimized database schema supporting sub-50ms response latency for the majority of embedding queries.

<h2> Hybrid Search Implementation </h2>

Goal: Implement a search mechanism combining text, vector, and metadata queries.

Deliverable: A hybrid search engine achieving high relevance and accuracy across multiple data modalities.

<h2> Query Routing API </h2>

Goal: Create an API that efficiently handles and routes diverse query types.

Deliverable: A fault-tolerant API with fallback mechanisms ensuring reliable query processing.
